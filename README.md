# Horiseon Webpage Refactoring Code


## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Description

This repository contains the source code to Horiseon website. In it, you will find image links, html structure used to build the site, and css stylesheet used to style the page. 

This is a refactoring project. I cleaned up the .html by utilizing semantic elements, re-structuring parent-child lines without compromising the look of the webpage and efficiency of the css.

## Tecnologies used

CSS
